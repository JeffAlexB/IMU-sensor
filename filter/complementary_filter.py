# complementary_filter.py

"""
Complementary filter for fusing gyro and absolute sensor data (like accel/mag).

This was the simplest way I found to get low-drift orientation from noisy signals.
It balances fast updates from the gyroscope with long-term stability from reference sensors.
Used for pitch, roll, and yaw estimation.
